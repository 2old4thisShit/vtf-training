## Hands-on Assignments: Day 3

[Michael Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office)) has reached out for our help. He wants to digitize the customer support process for [Dunder Mifflin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin). We (mostly you ðŸ˜‰) are tasked to build a very simple ticketing portal using Frappe Framework & FrappeUI. Let's start!

### Task 1: Backend Setup

Start by creating a new custom Frappe app named `simple_ticketing`. Now, create a new site and install this app on it.

### Task 2: Frontend Setup

**Step 1: New VueJS Project**

For the last time, we will manually setup a VueJS, TailwindCSS and FrappeUI based frontend app (SPA). Let's start by creating a new VueJS project inside our custom app:

```bash
$ cd apps/simple_ticketing
$ npm create vue@latest
```

> Note: we are setting up the VueJS project inside our custom app directory

Provide `frontend` when asked for a project name and `No` to everything else. Once this command has finished running, `cd` into the `frontend` directory:

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm install # install dependencies
$ npm run dev # start the development server
```

**Step 2: Setup TailwindCSS**

Follow [this guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#vue) to setup TailwindCSS in our newly created frontend project. Make sure you clean up your `App.vue` by removing the boilerplate code and test tailwindCSS is working properly by applying a few classes.

### Task 3: Setup FrappeUI

Start by installing the `frappe-ui` package:

```bash
$ npm install frappe-ui
```

> Note: Make sure you are running these commands inside the `frontend` directory

**Configuring TailwindCSS**

Now, open up your `tailwind.config.js` file and make the following additions:

```diff
+ import tailwindConfig from "frappe-ui/src/utils/tailwind.config";

export default {
+ presets: [tailwindConfig],
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
+   "./node_modules/frappe-ui/src/components/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
+   "../node_modules/frappe-ui/src/components/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  // ...
}
```

By making the above changes, we are configuring tailwind to use the design tokens (colors, sizing, etc.) from the `frappe-ui` package. You may need to restart your development server.

**Configuring Vite**

Open up `vite.config.js` file and add the following lines:

```diff
import { fileURLToPath, URL } from 'node:url'
+ import frappeui from "frappe-ui/vite";
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        vue(),
+       frappeui()
    ],
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            '@': fileURLToPath(new URL('./src', import.meta.url))
        }
    },
+   optimizeDeps: {
+       include: ["frappe-ui > feather-icons", "showdown", "engine.io-client"],
+   },
})
```

We are basically importing the `frappeui` vite plugin and telling vite to use it. As discussed in the lecture, this will setup the **proper proxy-ing of our API calls to the Frappe backend / web server**. This is needed in development because... remember? Because the development server and our Frappe server run on different ports. You will have to restart your development server after this change.

The `optimizeDeps` part helps in properly building some of `frappe-ui`'s dependencies (or packages). You don't have to worry much about this.

At this point, you will be good to go! You can now try importing a few components from `frappe-ui` and start using them in your `App` component.

> Note: Access your development site using the site URL: `<site-name>:8080` instead of `localhost:8080`. This is required for the proxy-ing part.

### Task 4: Header

Your first task is to create a header for our dashboard:

https://github.com/BuildWithHussain/vtf-training/assets/34810212/62364513-82c4-4ec3-999e-4ed4c8c1a3d1

Start by creating a new component named `Header.vue` and add it to your `App.vue` file. Here are the requirements for the header:

1. Place [this](https://github.com/BuildWithHussain/vtf-training/assets/34810212/f2574fab-2878-4c63-a721-6e30535cd4ce) logo image on the left end of the header.

2. Since our frontend app (SPA) lives outside of the desk (Frappe's admin interface), it has become a pattern to provide *an easy way to switch back to the desk*. Use the `Avatar` & `Dropdown` component from `frappe-ui` to implement what you see in the video above.

3. You can use this cool avatar placeholder: `https://i.pravatar.cc/300` for the avatar image. The size of the avatar is `2xl`.

4. Notice the cursor (pointer) when you hover over the avatar.
